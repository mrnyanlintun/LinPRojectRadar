RUN 44. THE SUCCESSOR FREEZE CANDIDATE IDENTITY.

Writes research/freeze/run44_freeze_candidate_identity.json in exactly the shape Run 41 wrote its
own, so the freeze gate's B01 blocker can recompute every digest from the tree and compare.

The Run-43 identity is NOT rewritten. It stays as that release wrote it and remains the identity
of the v28 predecessor; this file is its successor and names it as its parent.

THE MEMBER LISTS ARE DERIVED, NOT COPIED. The grouping (which files constitute the registry
authority, the taxonomy authority, and so on) is Run 37's and is reused deliberately, because
changing what a freeze measures at the same time as changing the instrument would make the two
incomparable. But the MEMBERS of the two globbed groups - every test_*.py the acceptance runner
globs, and the analytical layer - are re-derived from the filesystem, because Run 44 adds a suite
and a frozen list would silently stop covering it.

Usage: python tools/build_run44_candidate_identity.py [--candidate <commit>]
